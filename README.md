# Pok√©dex
Pokedex is a small web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It loads
data from an external API and enables viewing data points in detail.

## Project context
I built this app as part of my web Development course at CareerFoundry, where we learn programming by building a project.

It was required for the learning process that I used the Bootstrap framework in this project.


## App features
- Load data from an external source (API: https://pokeapi.co/)
- Display the first 150 Pokemons ordered by their ID
- On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), display details for that item

I plan to return to this project in the next months and add two more features: a search input field and a filter.
